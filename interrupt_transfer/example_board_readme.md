Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- FRDM-MCXE31B Board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
The example requires 2 sets of boards, each of them is mounted with the base board.
To make example work, connections needed to be as follows on each base board:

Board to board connections needed to be as follows:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        Node A           connect to      Node B
Pin Name   Board Location         Pin Name    Board Location
CANH       J17-1                  CANH        J17-1
CANL       J17-2                  CANL        J17-2
GND        J17-4                  GND         J17-4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prepare the Demo
===============
1.  Connect a type-c USB cable between the host PC and the MCU-Link USB port (J13) on the target board. 
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
After connecting the two boards, these instructions display on each terminal window.
One board must be chosen as node A and the other board as node B. (Note: Node B should start first)
Data is sent continuously between the node A and the node B.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This message displays on the node A terminal:

********* FLEXCAN Interrupt EXAMPLE *********
    Message format: Standard (11 bit id)
    Message buffer 1 used for Rx.
    Message buffer 0 used for Tx.
    Interrupt Mode: Enabled
    Operation Mode: TX and RX --> Normal
*********************************************

Please select local node as A or B:
Note: Node B should start first.
Node:A
Press any key to trigger one-shot transmission

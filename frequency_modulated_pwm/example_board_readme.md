Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- FRDM-MCXE31B Board
- Personal Computer
- Oscilloscope

Board settings
============
Probe the PWM signal using an oscilloscope
 - At J3-15 for PWM channel

Prepare the Demo
===============
1.  Connect a type-c USB cable between the host PC and the MCU-Link USB port (J13) on the target board. 
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, following information can be seen on the OpenSDA terminal:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
